	Classification label security determines the extent to which predicted labels from classification results can be trusted. The uncertainty surrounding classification labels is resolved by the security to which the classification is made. Therefore, classification label security is very significant for decision-making whenever we are encountered with a classification task. This thesis investigates the determination of the classification label security by utilizing fuzzy probabilistic assignments of Fuzzy c-means. The investigation is accompanied by implementation, experimentation, visualization and documentation of the results.
