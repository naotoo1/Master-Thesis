\chapter{Conclusion and Prospective Work}
This thesis investigated to determine the classification label security using fuzzy probabilistic assignments of FCM estimates. Chapter 4 exhibited by implementation, computation of the classification label security for the GLVQ, GMLVQ and CELVQ models. So for a given test set, the classification label security of all predicted labels is computed. The visualization of this implementation was accompanied by displaying the regions in the data space for which the considered models were confident or unconfident regarding the classification labels for the data sets used in the experimentations. We also determined the accuracy to which the models made the classifications when they were confident. The classification label security in this regard has been determined.
Concerning future work, a possibilistic approach to the determination of classification label security will be considered.
